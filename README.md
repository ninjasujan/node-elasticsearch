Elasticsearch is a distributed, free and open search and analytics engine for all types of data, including textual, numerical, geospatial, structured, and unstructured

### What is Elasticsearch used for?

The speed and scalability of Elasticsearch and its ability to index many types of content mean that it can be used for a number of use cases:

- Application search
- Website search
- Enterprise search
- Logging and log analytics
- Infrastructure metrics and container monitoring
- Application performance monitoring
- Geospatial data analysis and visualization
- Security analytics
- Business analytics

### How does Elasticsearch work?

Raw data flows into Elasticsearch from a variety of sources, including logs, system metrics, and web applications. Data ingestion is the process by which this raw data is parsed, normalized, and enriched before it is indexed in Elasticsearch. Once indexed in Elasticsearch, users can run complex queries against their data and use aggregations to retrieve complex summaries of their data

### What is Logstash used for?

Logstash, one of the core products of the Elastic Stack, is used to aggregate and process data and send it to Elasticsearch. Logstash is an open source, server-side data processing pipeline that enables you to ingest data from multiple sources simultaneously and enrich and transform it before it is indexed into Elasticsearch

### What is Kibana used for?

Kibana is a data visualization and management tool for Elasticsearch that provides real-time histograms, line graphs, pie charts, and maps. Kibana also includes advanced applications such as Canvas, which allows users to create custom dynamic infographics based on their data, and Elastic Maps for visualizing geospatial data.

### Why use Elasticsearch?

- **Elasticsearch is fast**:
  Because Elasticsearch is built on top of Lucene, it excels at full-text search. Elasticsearch is also a near real-time search platform, meaning the latency from the time a document is indexed until it becomes searchable is very short â€” typically one second

- **Elasticsearch is distributed by nature**:
  The documents stored in Elasticsearch are distributed across different containers known as shards, which are duplicated to provide redundant copies of the data in case of hardware failure

- **Elasticsearch comes with a wide set of features**: In addition to its speed, scalability, and resiliency, Elasticsearch has a number of powerful built-in features that make storing and searching data even more efficient, such as data rollups and index lifecycle management.

- **The Elastic Stack simplifies data ingest, visualization, and reporting:**
  ntegration with Beats and Logstash makes it easy to process data before indexing into Elasticsearch. And Kibana provides real-time visualization of Elasticsearch. APM - Application performance monitoring.
